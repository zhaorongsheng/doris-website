Therefore, memory management plays a crucial role in ensuring the stability of queries. According to online query statistics, a significant portion of query errors are related to memory issues. As more and more users migrate tasks such as ETL data processing, multi-table materialized view processing, and complex AdHoc queries to Doris, it is necessary to offload intermediate operation results to disk to enable the execution of queries that require more memory than each query or each node can handle. Specifically, when processing large datasets or executing complex queries, memory consumption can increase rapidly, exceeding the memory limits of a single node or the entire query processing process.
